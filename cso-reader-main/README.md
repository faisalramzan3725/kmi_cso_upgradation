# CSO Reader
This is a simple python script that helps reading and operating with the CSO Ontology


## Run

To begin you can run ```readCSO.py```. This will download the latest version of CSO and it will extract some simple stats.

Based on this file, and also by looking at the Ontology class, you can perform all sorts of experiments you like.

## Requirements

The code is pretty lightweight, hence it need just a few libraries:
```
configparser
os
sys
itertools
hurry.filesize
requests
pickle
csv
urllib.request
json
collections
```

All the above should be already available even in a brand new environment.
